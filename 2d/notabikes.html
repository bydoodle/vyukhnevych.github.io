                <span>While working on a project for the university, this logo was made. Creating a fictitious brand with an unconventional concept was the main objective of the assignment. I suggested starting a firm that would focus on creating personalized skateboards, scooters, and bicycles using discarded spare components. This term was taken from The Boring Company, who marketed flamethrowers under the moniker "Not a Flamethrower." Since young people were the main target market for our made-up company, I decided on a logo design that reflected this. The typeface looked like black-and-white graffiti set against a vector skateboard background.</span>
