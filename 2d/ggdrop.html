                <span>The social media banners for an internet retailer. Finding the supplies for this project took some time, but it was worthwhile. It was one of those instances where everything went as planned, and the piece came out precisely how I had envisioned. Keeping the picture in mind, I completed the task at hand; the client approved, and everyone was happy. I took a lot of time choosing the appropriate hues—harmonious, non-toxic neon that isn't glaring. It was then only a matter of piecing everything together in Photoshop, which is what you see.</span>
