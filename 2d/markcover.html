                <span>Making a cover for a musician was the assignment. I took the task very seriously and paid close attention to every detail, and the process was laborious and detailed. It was my first time working in this style, and to make matters more difficult, there was no graphics tablet, so I had to use a mouse to complete the entire piece. The photographs that are attached show how the project is progressing. Considering how much work went into it and how proud I am of the result, I think this is my most accomplished 2D painting to date.</span>
