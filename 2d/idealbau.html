                <span>I had to design a tiny construction company's logo. I drew a few ideas on paper and then copied them into Illustrator. The client was really precise, which made the task fascinating. Nevertheless, we were able to come to a mutually beneficial conclusion, and the business card's reverse side displays the completed logo. I also included my preferred variation. Like the earlier "Da Vinci" logo, this project offered invaluable experience working with overseas clientele.</span>
