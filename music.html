                On this page u can explore some of the songs that was created during work on some game projects. I always trying my best to create songs which will convey the mood of the game and accompany the player in the right mood. I also have a lot more works on my soundcloud which cannot be published here.

                <span>This song was written during a 48-hour game jam that I participated in with a group of four other people. I have never written music for a video game before. The main menu plays this music. It portrays a feeling of gloom and terror, even though the game itself isn't that scary.

                <span>This song was written as part of the same project as the preceding one. The game plays during gameplay. I was able to create the right rhythm that blended in perfectly with the game with the help of a straightforward amen break. The goal of the game is to hide from the locals and keep them awake, and this 8-bit tune goes perfectly with that. The tune captures a stealthy vibe. Owing to a lack of time and other challenges, I was forced to create a loop of this straightforward song.
